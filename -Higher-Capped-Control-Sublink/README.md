# -Higher-Capped-Control-Sublink
Makes the Control sublink have 4 additional tiers, adding up to +60% workspeed on all mechs. Each additional tier does require a High Control Sublink, mostly out of keeping a semblance of balance. I would have added more, or hell, straight up uncapped them, but Ludeon Coding makes it so each individual stage is ONE MORE LEVEL I have to manually code in. 

This mod has MIT licensing, you can use the code inside, yadda yadda. It's a simple XML Patch, so it really shouldn't be heavy in performance at all.

CE Incompatible.
